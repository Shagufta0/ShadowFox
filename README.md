How to Run:
-----------

1. Open the project folder in your preferred IDE (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ).
2. Make sure JDK is installed and properly set up.
3. Compile and run the .java files from the src/ folder or use the Run button in your IDE.
4. For GUI-based applications, a window will appear to interact with.
5. For JUnit tests, use the test runner available in your IDE or run via CLI using java -cp .:<junit-jar> org.junit.runner.JUnitCore <TestClass>.
